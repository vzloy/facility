Dear Colleagues, today, I'd like to share some insights on the sustainability of imaging and microscopy core facilities. As an imaging facility manager since 2009, with leadership experience spanning 15 years across five facilities, this topic is quite familiar to me. In this post, I will explore both business and technological aspects of sustainability. 

Typically, an imaging facility recovers operational costs such as staff salaries and service contracts. However, costs related to equipment depreciation and lab space charges often remain uncovered. Despite this, maintaining high-quality equipment is crucial.

But how do we define "high-quality" equipment? On average, new models of Zeiss or Leica confocal microscopes are released every 5.7 to 6.3 years. Equipment older than six years generally struggles to produce cutting-edge results. To stay competitive, it is advisable that at least 50% of our equipment is no older than 6-7 years. I believe this approach is a reasonable assumption for both business and technology planning.

I have developed a Python simulation to model the necessary annual addition of new microscopes to maintain an ideal average age of equipment. You are welcome to run this simulation on Google Colab and adjust the initial data to reflect your facility's specifics. If you encounter any errors or have questions, please feel free to contact me.
